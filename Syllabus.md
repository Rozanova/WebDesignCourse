> "I have been making websites from scratch by writing html and css, simply because i like to and not so simply because i reject the move fast and break things ethos with which so much of the internet has been built upon." 

> Emma Rae Norton, artist and technologist.



> “Even design centers are exposed to the complicity of the media, running the risk of failing to reach their original objective: to make a difference between design as intelligent problem solving and styling. After all, it is a question of a renaissance of the tradition of the Good Design Movement... The advocates of Good Design pursued socio-pedagogical objectives, while the life style centers of today pursue exclusively commercial and marketing aims to provide orientation for consumption patterns…”

> Gui Bonsiepe. Design and Democracy.



### Course Description and Objectives
This course is designed to teach students how to design user experiences (UX) for the web  while considering what types of digital products can and should be put out into the world as tools for the day-to-day (i.e. portfolio websites or social media platforms), as speculative art projects, or as critical design - forms of resistance to existing systems in place. 

The first part of the course is the design phase, which focuses on Human-Centered Design methodologies and competitive analysis, information architecture, rapid prototyping and usability testing. 
After an introduction to Human-Centered Design, Speculative Design, and Critical Design, students are encouraged to design critically whether for an experimental app that invites viewers to engage in dialogue about pressing social or environmental issues or for an app that is useful in our current daily routines.  Students will familiarize themselves with designing low and high fidelity wireframes for responsive web using the 960 grid system. They will use Figma or Adobe XD to create clickable prototypes and test their assumptions through usability tests. Lastly, they will learn how to present and defend their design decisions un group critiques. 


On phase two of the course, the website “development” portion, is where students will learn basics of web development. Students will learn front-end programming languages like HTML, CSS and some JavaScript to create responsive, mobile-first design for the browser. This part of the course will emphasize group work. Glitch will be used to code collaboratively. 

### Things to bring to class:
:notebook: notebook & :pencil: pencil or :pen: pen



### Tools we will use:
Fima (or Adobe XD, if you prefer. I cover both), Google Jam Board, a blog (like Medium, Tumblr, or a blog of your choice), are.na (or Pinterest), and Slack. 



### Projects:
Students will design an app that will fit in one of the following categories: 
1. A portfolio site that showcases your work.
2. App as civic engagement tool.
3. Speculative app a design/art project to address potential future societal needs.
4. Critical app design as design/art project that critiques existing social and cultural systems.

### Assessment and grading
Where applicable, all projects will be evaluated according to the following criteria
in equal weight:

#### Research and ideation: 
Whether and how much thought and investigation have been given toward a particular project in order to arrive at a clear and strong concept.

#### Overall design and concept: 
Formal design quality and how well the piece meets the strategic goals of the project.

#### Organization of content: 
Expression of visual hierarchy, clarity of communication.

#### Execution and craft: 
How well the work meets professional standards, in terms of quality of resolution of images, spelling, and placement of correct native UI elements in the layout. 

The degree of improvement in the quality of a student’s work over the course of the
semester may also be considered in the evaluation of a final grade.
Your final grade will be assessed according to the percentages below:
* Homework assignment completion.............50%
* Quality of work: ..........................10%
* Midterm: ..................................10%
* Attendance: ...............................10%
* Participation: ............................10%
* Final: ....................................10%


### General Policies including lateness/absence
Students are expected to arrive in class on time and prepared to work for the entire class
period. Although in-class work sessions are an integral component of this course, outside
work on assignments will be required to meet project deadlines. Significant progress
between classes is expected. Projects are due at the beginning of each class.

Candidates are expected to attend every class session of each course in which they are
enrolled and to be on time. A candidate cannot receive credit for a course if absent more
than two times. No distinction is made between excused and unexcused absences. An
instructor may treat lateness as equivalent to absence.

Students who are absent are expected to find out from other students about what they
missed in class as well as any assignments due, and make up the work.
Students who are marked as Absent for more than two classes will have their final grades
reduced by one full letter grade for each additional time they are marked Absent. For
example, and A student who is marked as Absent three times will receive a final grade of B,
one who is marked as Absent four times will receive a final grade of C, and so on.
Students who are more than ten minutes late to class will be marked as Late. Students who
are marked as Late five times will receive a one-quarter letter-grade reduction to their final
grades. (For example, a student who would have been given an A as a final grade who is
marked as Late five times will be given a final grade of A-). Students who are marked as Late
more than five times will receive a one-quarter letter-grade reduction for each additional
time they are marked as Late. (For example, that same student would be given a B+ if she
were marked as Late six times, and a B if she were marked as Late seven times). Students
who are marked as Late eight or more times will receive a grade of F for the course.
A break will be designated in each class. Students are asked to refrain from leaving the
classroom at any time other than that designated for the class break, except in cases
of emergency. Students who fail to adhere to this policy repeatedly will be subject to a
reduction in final grade. Students who are more than ten minutes late returning from break
will be marked as Late for the entire class.

Late assignments will be given a one-quarter letter grade reduction for each class they are
late. Missing assignments will be given a grade of F.

If you know you are going to be absent, contact the professor by email in advance. For the most up-to-date information (including what is due next class) visit the class’s Slack channel (to which you have been invited).


### Academic Integrity
Academic dishonesty is prohibited in Queens College of New York. Penalties for academic
dishonesty include academic sanctions, such as failing or otherwise reduced grades, and/or
disciplinary sanctions, including suspension or expulsion. Cheating is the unauthorized use or
attempted use of material, information, notes, study aids, devices or communication during
an academic exercise. Plagiarism is the act of presenting another person’s ideas, research
or writings as your own. More information is available at http://sps.cuny.edu/acad_policies/

### Grading


## To earn an A
All class work and homework is excellent. Projects have been completed when assigned. The work shows a development and understanding of the principles discussed in class. It is presented immaculately. There is regular and prompt attendance and participation during critiques and an enthusiasm toward the material being presented throughout the semester. This is exceptional work.

## To earn a B
All assigned work completed in a thorough manner. An understanding of the principles and lessons covered in class is evident. The student comes to class regularly and on time and participates in critiques and discussions. This is better than average work.

## To earn a C
Most class assignments and homework have been completed. Regular attendance but minimal or negative class participation. There is understanding of most of what’s being presented in class. This student shows some interest in the course content. This is average work.

## To earn a D
Most class assignments and homework have not been completed. Marginal effort made to understand the course objectives and very little or negative participation on behalf of the student. Spotty attendance. This means below average work.

## To earn an F
Student has not completed 1⁄3 of the course work and has missed too many classes. This student doesn’t participate or has a bad attitude and shows no interest. It means not enough work, attendance, and/or effort to pass the class.
